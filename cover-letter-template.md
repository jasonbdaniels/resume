**Dear Hiring Manager**,

I'm applying for the open position of *_Position_*. I found this job while conducting my own job search on _Platform_, and was particularly interested because of the popular reputation _Company Name_ has as a software consulting company. If hired I would be a valuable asset to _Company Name_ because of my skills and unique experience with agile methodologies.

I'm also interested in this job, because I've always enjoyed helping others learn and improve. My experience with Agile methodologies makes me a great fit for a *_Position_*, because I have, for the most part, played out this role in my previous job. For example, I would often hold other team member accountable for specific agile purposes, such as staying focused to the purposes of a stand-up, or making sure enough attention was given to backlog-refinement. I've also helped the team realize progress through display of burndown charts via an auto updated Slack post. Lastly, my desire for details coupled with a talented technical background, will allow me to conquer all essential job functions by bringing clarity to business needs and focus to development work.

In closing, my desire to help others will fuel my passion to perform essential _Position_ duties that are guided by previous agile experiences. I look forward to an interview to discuss employment opportunities. Please feel free to contact my be phone or email (If by phone please leave a message if prompted). Thank you for taking the time to consider my application.

Thank you,
